# Author insights

Honestly, this isn't even close to minesweeper. I'm just rendering tiles and randomly deciding if they are bombs or not. I mostly created this super small project just to familiarize myself with SolidJS and see what it has to offer.

After playing with it, I could see myself developing in SolidJS in the future and I would say I enjoy it more than React.

Having an easy to setup project and not having to worry about the dependency graph (unlike React) is a selling point to me - this is great stuff! :)

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
